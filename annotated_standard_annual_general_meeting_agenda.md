## Voting
Depending on the motion in question, the chair can conduct a vote in several ways:
- Consensus vote: For minor and uncontroversial matters, the chair can simply ask "any objections". If there are none, then the motion is taken as passed.
- Voice vote: The chair can call for those in favour. If the votes seem like a vast majority, then the chair should call for a perfunctory vote of those against. The chair can then state something along the lines of "I think the ayes have it". A member can object to this and force a counted vote. If the votes seem equal after calling for the against votes, then the chair should conduct a counted vote. If the votes in favour seem like a vast minority, then the chair can instead state "I think the nays have it" after the votes against.
- Counted vote: The chair should call for those in favour, count them and announce the number, then call for the votes against, count them and announce the number, and determine the outcome based on the counts.
- Secret ballot: Elections must be a secret ballot. A member can request any other vote to be a secret ballot. This should be used sparingly.
## Procedural Motions
These motions relate the the meeting itself, and can generally interrupt normal motions. They must be voted on, but usually not debated. There are others, but they are unlikely to be needed by UQCS
- Put the motion: End debate of the current/main motion and proceed to vote on it, used if a member thinks that further debate in unnecessary. First, the procedural motion is voted on. If it passes, then the main motion is voted on.
- Table the motion: Delay the discussion and voting of the current motion until the next meeting.
- Adjourn the meeting: suspend the meeting for a short duration of time (i.e. measurable in minutes).
- Close the meeting: close the meeting.
- Dissent in the chair: if a member believes that the chair has erred in their duties, they may raise dissent to debate this. This should be used sparingly.
 
[^1]: A procedural motion may be moved to consider any tabled motions at the start of Business Proposed
